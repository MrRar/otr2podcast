<p class="Normal tm5 tm6"><span class="tm9"><br /></span><strong><span class="tm10">The Father Brown Stories</span></strong><span class="tm11"> were written by G K Chesterton. Father John Brown was a Roman Catholic priest from East Anglia who solved mysteries by intuition rather than detection, he was famed for carrying an umbrella. The vicar criminologist
is often helped by the criminal Flambeau. The radio plays were 30 minutes in length for each episode and were narrated and starred Andrew Sachs.<br /><br />The Father Brown Stories were originally broadcast on BBC Radio 4
between 1984 and 1987. </span></p>
